Project Objectives:
The objective of the project is to develop an automated, console-based game hub, a portal to 
digital delight at the tap of a key. 
You are expected to apply the Python basic coding skills to write programs gathered during 
previous all sprints for this project. Python basic codes will be used based on the requirements 
provided.
The objective of this sprint is to develop console-based games: arithmetic puzzle game and 
riddle-based puzzle game. Perform project tasks mentioned in following slides to develop the 
games.
Christine Fernandes, the effervescent HR manager in an IT company, wants to engage and 
refresh the employees from their routine and packed working hours with a secret weapon - Fun 
Friday. Every week, Christine transforms the sleek conference room into a playground for 
weary minds. She wants an automated application to run console-based computer games with 
options. One Friday, her vision was ambitious: an automated, console-based game hub, a portal 
to digital delight at the tap of a key. 
Help her by developing the automated hub of the code of Friday fun, one pixelated adventure 
at a time.
The manager has shared his requirements and gaming application as following. The programs 
should be re-usable in any part of the project.
Application must consist of a set of console-based gaming programs: 
Part 1: Creating program to develop arithmetic puzzle game and riddle-based puzzle game. 
Part 2: Creating program to develop rock paper scissors game.
Part 3: Creating program to develop Word guessing game.
Plug all the programs developed in Part 1, 2 and 3 into a menu driven application where all the 
programs will be called through function calls.
